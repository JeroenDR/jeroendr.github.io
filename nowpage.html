								<p>I'm currently working for the City of New York, as you can tell from my resume page. This past year we have been mostly upgrading technologies. Currently updating the last few pages in our system from
								ExtJS 4.2 to 6.5. This is sometimes pretty challenging as the system is using quite some custom code.</p>
								<p>Besides programming myself, I manage a small team of front end developers and work on the project planning of some of our future projects.</p>

									<p>Besides keeping this site up to date I'm working on two other sites at the moment. You can check out both on the top in the menu.</p>
									<p><b>FilmStat</b> is a small page that allows a user to upload his or her IMDB or Letterboxd movielist and get some analysis back. At the moment I give stats based on movie years and directors.
									It provides a quick overview of your movie watching preferences in the past. I'm planning to provide some extra stats in the future. The next
								few will probably be genres, AFI top 100 list, IMDB top250 stats and Best picture winners. This way it will be easy to identify gaps in your movie watching history. Also planning
							to add an easier way to connect your IMDB or Letterboxd accounts in the near future.</p>
							<p><b>LocationScout</b> is a work in progress and still in its early phase. It will provide a list of filming locations around New York City and provide a map overlay to help you find used movie locations in the city.
								It also provides a helpful tool for amateur filmmakers which helps them find the perfect location for their shoot.</p>
							<p><b>Untitled film project</b> will be a short film set in New York and probably be around 3 minutes long, more information to follow.</p>
							<p><b>37Film</b> will be youtube channel that is just a collection of long shots that could also be used as establishing shots, each shot will be 37 seconds long.</p>
							<p><b>One Sheet Film</b> is an instagram and twitter account that I started, it's dedicated to the art of movie posters. Follow me by clicking the buttons on the bottom of this page.</p>

			 <p>I usually try to have a good mix between fiction and non fiction in my reading. At the moment I am reading three books. One before I go to bed, one for my commute and one that I take my
				 time for during weekends. Below you find my current selection of books with a short description of what I think of them so far. Feel free to follow me on goodreads by clicking the button at the bottom of the page.</p>

							<h4>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</h4>
							<h6>By : William Shirer</h6>
							<p>This book has been sitting in my shelves for years and this year I decided to finish it. It focusses mainly on the politics and decisions that were made within
							the third reich. So far I'd recommend it although only if you're really into World War 2 since it's quite a long read. Not recommended if you are only interested in
						 military history.</p>

						 <h4>How to watch a movie</h4>
						 <h6>By : David Thomson</h6>
						 <p>Picked this one up based on its cover and title. So far it's a pretty average overview of the history of film the last 60 years or so. Explaining what certain
						 filmmakers try to achieve with camera movements or set pieces in a movie. Nothing ground breaking or new but still a quick interesting read. Perfect for a subway book. If anything
					 	I think this book will mainly expand my already extensive watchlist.</p>

						 <h4>In Europe</h4>
						 <h6>By : Geert Mak</h6>
						 <p>Very interesting read, writer Geert Mak travels through Europe at the end of the 20th century while he looks back to the history of Europe during this
					   last century. It draws quite some parallels with the war in Kosovo - which was still raging when he wrote this book. The best parts of the book are  the ones were he
					 described personal anecdotes describing how life was during the war(s).</p>
