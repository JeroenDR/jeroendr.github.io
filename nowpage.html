								<p>I'm currently working for the City of New York, as you can tell from my resume page. Currently we are upgrading some older frameworks. After redesigning the main screens we now moved to updating Struts.</p>
								<p>Besides programming myself, I manage a small team of front end developers and work on the project planning of some of our future projects.</p>
								<p>Outside of the upgrade work we are also in maintenance mode currently and we are fixing smaller issues that have been in the system for a while, but we finally have some time to look at them.</p>

									<p>Besides keeping this site up to date I'm working on two other sites at the moment. You can check out both on the top in the menu.</p>
									<p><b>FilmStat</b> is a small page that allows a user to upload his or her IMDB movielist and get some analysis back. At the moment I give stats based on movie years, genres and directors.
									It provides a quick overview of your movie watching preferences in the past. I'm planning to provide some extra stats in the future as well as Letterboxd support. The next
								few will probably be IMDB top250 stats and providing a sample list button. This way it will be easy to identify gaps in your movie watching history. Also planning
							to add an easier way to connect your IMDB (or Letterboxd) accounts in the near future.</p>
							<p><b>LocationScout</b> is a work in progress and still in its early phase. It will provide a list of filming locations around New York City and provide a map overlay to help you find used movie locations in the city.
								It also provides a helpful tool for amateur filmmakers which helps them find the perfect location for their shoot.</p>
							<p><b>Untitled film project</b> will be a short film set in New York and probably be around 3 minutes long, more information to follow.</p>
							<p><b>37Film</b> is youtube channel that is just a collection of long shots that could also be used as establishing shots, each shot is 37 seconds long. You can find a link at the bottom of the page.</p>
							<p><b>One Sheet Film</b> is an instagram and twitter account that I started, it's dedicated to the art of movie posters. Follow me by clicking the buttons on the bottom of this page.</p>

			 <p>I usually try to have a good mix between fiction and non fiction in my reading. At the moment I am reading three books. One before I go to bed, one for my commute and one that I take my
				 time for during weekends. Below you find my current selection of books with a short description of what I think of them so far. Feel free to follow me on goodreads by clicking the button at the bottom of the page.</p>

							<h4>The Guns of August</h4>
							<h6>By : Barbara W. Tuchman</h6>
							<p>Another war related book this time, The Guns of August focusses on the first few months of the first World War. Very interesting so far since it does not
							only focus on the way this war was thought to us - the assassination and the German agression. It shows how all sides were on a path towards war that would shape Europe and the world for decades and probably centuries to come.</p>

						 <h4>The Everything Store</h4>
						 <h6>By : Brad Stone</h6>
						 <p>It's hard not to be intrigued by Jeff Bezos and the Amazon story, even after more than two decades of growth it still seems there is nothing stopping Amazon. I'm fascinated how a lot of companies like Alphabet, Amazon and Apple
						 focus on more than their core business over time to grow. So far this book has been extremely interesting, especially the history of early Amazon. </p>

						 <h4>War and Peace</h4>
						 <h6>By : Leo Tolstoy</h6>
						 <p>Another year, so another +1000 pages book to read. This time the classic War and Peace. I'm still in the first Volume of the book so it's still hard to judge the book by just that. So far
						 I am a fan of the mix between Russian and French in the story and the introduction of all the characters through a party.</p>
